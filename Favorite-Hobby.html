		<p>Perennials are plants that usually live for more than 2 years and usually return seasonally. Annuals are plants that are short lived and only live for one season. Colorado has a wide variety of beautiful Perennials that return each year. When planning or looking to add plants to the garden I turn to perennials.</p>

		<p>Colorado has usually warm summers, cold snowy winters, and spring snow storms are common. Perennials are also economically convinient comsidering colorados crazy weather. The states official flower is the Columbine and yes this geargeous flower is a Perennial.  Another great plant to use is Salvia 'May Night', with its beautiful purple color.<em></p>

		<p>Gardening is very calming and a great stress releaver. Definitly is theraputic is nature. There is nothing better than getting your hands dirty in soil and the smell of the earth. One does not need to be an expert gardener in order to create lovely garden scapes, preferably with Perennials.</p>
