	<h2><b>Jessica Rivera</b></h1>

	<div>

		<p>My favorite childhood memory was going camping with my family. We would enjoy driving up the Rocky Mountains and finding the perfect spot.<br /> When that spot was found, usually by a meadow, we would happily set up camp. The best thing was when night came around. Smores where cooked on an open fire and the grownups would tell scary stories.</p>

		<p>Another great memory from camping was waking up the next day in the wilderness. Hearing the birds and smelling the fresh air was amazing. Of course on the second day, <em>the real adventures begins.</em> </p>
